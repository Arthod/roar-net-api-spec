# ROAR-NET API Specification

This repository contains the ROAR-NET API Specification. For more
information about the specification see the introduction in
[src/README.md](./src/README.md).

**Note**: This specification is still in an early development phase,
and as such no officially released version is available yet.

## Requirements

The specification is built with
[mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/), see the installation
instructions in [their
documentation](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/guide/installation.html).

## Building

To build the specification run:

```sh
mdbook build
```

This will generate a `book` folder with the html of the specification.

## Development

While writing it can be handy to see your changes, you can use the
following command to serve the book:

```sh
mdbook serve
```

## Acknowledgement

This specification is based upon work from COST Action [Randomised
Optimisation Algorithms Research Network
(ROAR-NET)](https://www.roar-net.eu/), CA22137, supported by COST
(European Cooperation in Science and Technology).

COST ([European Cooperation in Science and
Technology](https://www.cost.eu)) is a funding agency for research and
innovation networks. Our Actions help connect research initiatives
across Europe and enable scientists to grow their ideas by sharing them
with their peers. This boosts their research, career and innovation.
