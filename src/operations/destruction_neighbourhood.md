# Destruction neighbourhood

## Signature

```text
destruction_neighbourhood(Problem) : Neighbourhood
```

## Description

This function returns the destruction neighbourhood structure of the
given problem instance. In a constructive-search model of a
combinatorial optimisation problem, the destruction neighbourhood
structure, or destruction rule, dictates how complete or partial
solutions may be made progressively less complete until an empty
solution is reached.

## Use cases

A destruction neighbourhood structure is required by some constructive
search approaches, such as ruin and recreate.
