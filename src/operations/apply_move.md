# Apply move

## Signature

```text
apply_move(Move, Solution) : Solution
```

## Description

This function applies a move to a solution in order to produce the
corresponding neighbour.

## Pre-requisites

The given move must have been generated under some neighbourhood for
the given solution or a pristine copy of it, or be the inverse of the
move that produced the given solution.

## Use cases

Applying moves to solutions is required by all optimisation algorithms
in order to visit new solutions.
