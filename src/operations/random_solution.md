# Random solution

## Signature

```text
random_solution(Problem) : Solution
```

## Description

This function samples the feasible decision space of the given problem
instance uniformly at random (with replacement) and produces a
feasible solution.

## Use cases

Random solutions are often used as initial solutions in local
search. The initial population of evolutionary algorithms typically
consists of solutions generated at random.
