# Invert move

## Signature

```text
invert_move(Move) : Move
```

## Description

This function produces the inverse of a given move. If a given move
can be applied to a solution A to obtain solution B, then applying its
inverse to solution B must produce solution A. As a consequence, the
inverse of a construction move must be a valid destruction move and
vice-versa.

## Use cases

Obtaining the inverse of moves allows backtracking to be performed
from a given solution by applying the inverse of each move previously
applied to the solution in reverse order. This assumes that storing,
inverting and applying moves is generally more efficient than copying
and storing solutions.
